                        There are many ways that we might be able to integrate other platforms or transfer content from your existing site to your new one. We'll be sure to go over all of this in your initial consult.

                        Absolutely! During our planning discussions, we'll determine which parts of your site you'll need to update regularly, and I'll customize the backend to make those areas easy for you to edit. And if you ever need design changes or deeper updates, RamoSites has got you covered!

                        The first step is <a href="/start">filling out the Get Started form</a> to let me know a little bit about what you're looking for. After you submit the form you'll get a link to schedule our inital consult meeting along with a few other steps you can take to prepare. A contract will be drawn up after our inital meeting and our journey to your dreams will proceed!
